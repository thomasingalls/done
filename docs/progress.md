# done — Active slice

**This file is disposable, and that is its function.** It holds the slice of work that is active right now
and nothing else. Nothing of record value lives here: decisions go to [decisions.md](./decisions.md), and
closed work goes to [completed.md](./completed.md).

## How this file works

**Everything below the rule is replaced wholesale when the active slice changes.** Not amended, not struck
through, not archived in place — deleted and rewritten. A working document that accretes is a working
document nobody reads, and the two files that _are_ records already exist.

**One thing must happen first.** When a slice closes, write its outcome into
[completed.md](./completed.md) _before_ rewriting this file. That ordering is the only thing protecting
the record, because after the rewrite the evidence is gone.

**It grows a tree when the slice deepens.** If work goes deeper without the slice changing — an item turns
out to have four parts, one of which has three — nest it. Nesting is free and says something true about
the shape of the work. What is _not_ allowed is a second top-level slice **inside one document**: two active
slices in one document means it has stopped answering the question it exists to answer, and one of them is
really next-up.

**The file is a stream of documents, one per seat, separated by `---` as YAML separates its own.** The
original rule assumed one slice because it assumed one worker, and that assumption broke the first time two
gates ran in parallel seats — `L-1` in its worktree and `L-2` in another, neither waiting on the other,
neither with anywhere honest to say so. A seat owns its own document and edits nothing below or above the
separator, which is what keeps the wholesale-replacement rule intact per document and keeps two live sessions
out of each other's paragraphs. Each document opens with its keys, because once there is more than one the
first question is always *whose is this, and where is it running* — gate, seat, branch, status, and what
blocks it.

**One document per seat is a ceiling, not a target.** A second document is a claim that two gates genuinely
do not block each other, checkable at `action-tree.md`'s prerequisites — not a place to park work that is
really next-up. When a seat's slice closes, its outcome goes to [completed.md](./completed.md) and **its
document is deleted**, separator and all.

**Status vocabulary**, deliberately small: **not started** · **in flight** · **done** · **blocked** (which
must name what it is blocked on).

**Being wrong here is cheap.** This file is allowed to lag by a day. It is not allowed to describe a slice
that is no longer active.

## Active slice: Stage 1 — corrected encrypted-store implementation (`L-1`)

```yaml
gate: L-1
seat: /Users/thomasingalls/.codex/worktrees/c030/done
branch: codex/encrypted-store-contract-corrections
status: in flight # authority/preflight complete; durable promotion intent and device custody next
plan: [sequencing.md §3.5, action-tree.md L-1, account-sync-prep.md, account-authority.md]
prerequisites: corrected SC-01–09; historical S0-10 closure covers represented cases only
debts: consult docs/review/remediation/debts.json # component evidence does not pay whole obligations
updated: 2026-09-10
```

**Personal checkpoint.** The author confirmed edit survival through full close and normal reopen at
`17d87c2`. The preview remains stopped at their request; relay is off. The verified release stays at
`.dev/releases/17d87c2/app` and predecessor `dist/` is intact. Origin/Tailscale routing is unchanged.
Build and server stay in this worktree/Codex session. The author controls their browser and factors.

**Recovery committed; trusted-root/preflight component complete.** Signed `e9477aa` commits the
account core; signed `0f1a073` commits recovery sealing and restart-owned confirmation. The new
[authority contract](./account-authority.md) provides explicit encrypted service-root initialization,
cold open/recovery with no automatic rekeying, independent client pin verification, and a fixed-purpose
nonce proof through the private adapter. No actual root/pin/operator secret or personal account has
been provisioned. The service root does not authenticate itself by appearing next to its signature.

The read-only Local preflight verifies mandatory custody and source identity under slot exclusion,
cold-replays content plus journal, refuses admission material or pending dependencies, then verifies the
pinned root proof. Its proposed lineage/recovery context is stable for this source/account; it grants
no service admission and freezes no content snapshot. Local custody, keys, counters, routing and writing
remain unchanged. Accounts remain pending, with no ordinary account UI or activation exposed.

[Preserved evidence](./account-conformance-runs/2026-09-10-account-authority.md): 13 authority/preflight
tests, including 160 generated root and 40 generated browser histories, process kills and competing
creators, two observed acceptance controls, native journal/refusal/imported-claim/cancellation checks,
all 55 account/recovery regressions (400 more generated histories), and 825 existing unit tests pass.
TypeScript, focused static checks and isolated application build checks pass. The preliminary test-page
CSP blocked the journal's WASM; the disposable app harness was corrected while API CSP stayed unchanged.
No generated production counterexample, debt payment or matrix status change is claimed.

**Next bounded write phase.** Implement the durable authenticated promotion intent and prepare fresh
device signing/wrapping credentials under mandatory custody. Revalidate this Local source, trusted pin
and exact current recovery/account state, retain the application-upgrade interlock before incompatible
carriers, reserve seal budgets durably and inventory all new references. Preserve the current generation,
counters, Local identity and index throughout preparation; resume the same winning intent/keys after a
crash. Own explicit abandonment/reset, including the preceding recovery ceremony's terminal states.

**Following phase.** Build verified genesis, exact recovery/device wraps, certified recipients, first
authorization/acceptance head, and the service/local-index handoff before activation. The existing
principal, workspace and physical content store carry over; no Local duplicate or copied profile is
created. The first slot binding must verify against independently pinned authority. The actual second
pre-encryption device then adopts this workspace with fresh custody/store/counters/credentials and
no import or merge of its old writing; its cleanup stays separate.

**Remaining gates.** Complete promotion and bindings, encrypted relay/durable storage, two-gate enrollment,
revocation/rotation/finalization and full recovery, complete product conformance, whole-profile residue,
platform coverage, production root distribution/restore and independent review remain open. Incompatible
formats require a concrete authenticated upgrade owner and tested exclusion/restart rules. The host VM
stays stopped; host/policy research is not next-up. L-2's historical clean ref `d24732b` has no further
service work to integrate. This outcome was appended to completed.md before this rewrite; L-2 is unchanged.

## Active slice: Stage 4's first pieces — authorization, acceptance and transition integration (`L-2`)

```yaml
gate: L-2
seat: .claude/worktrees/l2-onboarding-863db1
branch: claude/l2-onboarding-863db1 # forked from claude/l1-contract-pass at 1375ee6
status: in flight # R3-4 paid; the slot verifier landed; the account service is next
plan: [sequencing.md §3.5, action-tree.md L-2]
prerequisites: S0-10 (closed 2026-08-29), especially S0-2/S0-4 — not L-1
debts: none # node scripts/check-debts.mjs --gate L-2 lifts
updated: 2026-08-29
```

**Why this runs beside `L-1` rather than after it.** `L-2`'s prerequisites are `S0-10`, especially `S0-2` and
`S0-4` — [action-tree.md](./review/remediation/action-tree.md)'s node names them and does not name `L-1`. The
two rejoin at `L-3`, which lists both. The critical-path diagram in
[sequencing.md](./sequencing.md) §4 draws Stage 4 after Stage 2 because that is the order the *product* ships
in; §5.1 already settled that the service's construction does not wait, since *ships* means someone else's
data and the author synchronizing his own devices is development. So milestones 5 and 6 are reached while
review 3b is out, and what waits for 3b's answer is exposing another person to it.

**What this slice is.** Stage 4's internal order, taken in order (§3.5): the account service, the
authenticator and the device-local slot verifier; the recovery keypair and the code ceremony; the
authorization lineage, first signed head, genesis checkpoint and promotion; device signing and wrapping
credentials; the envelope layer, relay rewrite and content-blind durable store; enrollment's two gates; the
device list; rotation, revocation, acceptance evidence and the finalization boundary. **Mostly indivisible:**
a device list that cannot revoke is worse than no device list, so nothing ships until item 8.

**What has landed.**

- **`R3-4`, first, because it was owed first** (`fbdbfb4`). `S0-9` round 3 returned member-entry uniqueness to
  `S0-2`'s homes *before `L-2` implements a verifier*, and this is that moment. A certified set carrying two
  entries under one `credential_id` is now malformed at both homes, the four map entries pinning them are
  re-pinned with every entry held, and `pnpm recipient:check` carries the sentence as a byte rule — added
  beyond the named repair because the generator's object-keyed `members` cannot express a duplicate, so no
  published negative can ever cover it. Recorded at
  [`S0-2/README.md`](./review/remediation/S0-2/README.md) and as a dated addendum on the disposition.
  **This makes one line of the `L-1` document above stale** — its *not in this slice* paragraph still says
  `R3-4` is owed. Correct then, wrong now, and the `L-1` seat's line to drop rather than this one's to edit:
  the separator only means anything if it holds when crossing it would be convenient.
- **The device-local slot verifier** (`b8c267a`), `src/account/slotUnlock.ts` — TRD §13.9, §15 row 12, item 1's
  half that needs nothing from `L-1`. The service-signed binding is verified before the key it names is used;
  refusals are values rather than messages. Held to `test/vectors/account-credential.json`, with the negatives
  rebuilt against `src/` rather than replayed, and a fifteen-mutation battery run against it — eleven caught,
  four survivors all in the compiled-in encoding set, all closed by two tests that pin the check's *position*
  rather than its presence.

**What is next, in the plan's order.** The account service and the authenticator ceremony that mints these
credentials — the two halves of item 1 the verifier does not cover — then the recovery keypair and the code
ceremony, which §3.5 puts at account creation rather than later because there is no account without it.

**Two things `L-2` needs that it does not own.** §6.5's slot index is where a verified binding is *stored*,
and it is `L-1`'s item 2; the verifier is a pure function over published bytes and did not wait for it, but
the enrollment path will. And §11.2's hostile-relay tests need `relayNetwork()` in `test/replicas.ts` able to
withhold, reorder and deliver late — §3.5 names extending it as far cheaper than a second harness, and it is
worth building before item 5 rather than during it.

**Not in this slice.** `L-1`'s document above, which this seat does not edit. `L-3` and `L-4`, and the four
registered debts at `L-4`. The live Stage 2 cutover. Review 3b's answer gates exposure, not construction
(§5.1) — and reviewer answers that constrain implementation are `L-4` gates.
