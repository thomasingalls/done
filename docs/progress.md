# done — Active slice

**This file is disposable, and that is its function.** It holds the slice of work that is active right now
and nothing else. Nothing of record value lives here: decisions go to [decisions.md](./decisions.md), and
closed work goes to [completed.md](./completed.md).

## How this file works

**Everything below the rule is replaced wholesale when the active slice changes.** Not amended, not struck
through, not archived in place — deleted and rewritten. A working document that accretes is a working
document nobody reads, and the two files that _are_ records already exist.

**One thing must happen first.** When a slice closes, write its outcome into
[completed.md](./completed.md) _before_ rewriting this file. That ordering is the only thing protecting
the record, because after the rewrite the evidence is gone.

**It grows a tree when the slice deepens.** If work goes deeper without the slice changing — an item turns
out to have four parts, one of which has three — nest it. Nesting is free and says something true about
the shape of the work. What is _not_ allowed is a second top-level slice **inside one document**: two active
slices in one document means it has stopped answering the question it exists to answer, and one of them is
really next-up.

**The file is a stream of documents, one per seat, separated by `---` as YAML separates its own.** The
original rule assumed one slice because it assumed one worker, and that assumption broke the first time two
gates ran in parallel seats — `L-1` in its worktree and `L-2` in another, neither waiting on the other,
neither with anywhere honest to say so. A seat owns its own document and edits nothing below or above the
separator, which is what keeps the wholesale-replacement rule intact per document and keeps two live sessions
out of each other's paragraphs. Each document opens with its keys, because once there is more than one the
first question is always *whose is this, and where is it running* — gate, seat, branch, status, and what
blocks it.

**One document per seat is a ceiling, not a target.** A second document is a claim that two gates genuinely
do not block each other, checkable at `action-tree.md`'s prerequisites — not a place to park work that is
really next-up. When a seat's slice closes, its outcome goes to [completed.md](./completed.md) and **its
document is deleted**, separator and all.

**Status vocabulary**, deliberately small: **not started** · **in flight** · **done** · **blocked** (which
must name what it is blocked on).

**Being wrong here is cheap.** This file is allowed to lag by a day. It is not allowed to describe a slice
that is no longer active.

## Active slice: General validation-runner integration — remaining test adapters (`L-1`)

```yaml
gate: L-1
seat: /Users/thomasingalls/.codex/worktrees/c030/done
branch: codex/encrypted-store-contract-corrections
status: not started
blocks_on: none; next bounded implementation extends the reviewed general test adapters
debts: consult docs/review/remediation/debts.json
updated: 2026-09-13
```

**Just completed.** R-01's [bounded repair](./review/implementation/service-receiver-bounds.md) is
signed and verified as `5872dc5`. The [first general Vitest adapter](./release-validation-execution.md#vitest-property-adapter--phase-2m)
resolves five R-03/N-06 suites: 62 exact cases, unchanged 515 seeded histories, finite AST census,
complete runtime reconciliation and owned process execution. Its implementation is uncommitted.
The five properties now have explicit 60-second limits inside separate 180-second file stages.

**Evidence.** The final disposable selection passes all 62 cases in 56.2 seconds including preparation;
the prior post-deadline run took 67.9 seconds. Generated properties take 1.0–6.2 seconds across these runs. Assertions, seeds and history counts are unchanged by AST
comparison. All 91 non-native runner controls/regressions pass with 2,560 generated control histories.
Actual omission, skip, zero-case, counterexample, inner/outer timeout, cancellation and detached-child
controls retain nine receipts and proved drain. The [archive](./account-conformance-runs/2026-09-13-vitest-properties/README.md)
retains the first reporter/fixture failures. These are host observations, not a loaded-host guarantee.
Existing eleven native browser ownership controls retain prior evidence; no browser campaign reran.

**Next bounded phase.** Extend the remaining Vitest case shapes and reviewed Node test families;
then integrate Playwright, deliberate nested owners and exact wrapper variants/postconditions.
R-04 still requires explicit live-file versus immutable-archive style scope, live repairs and full
style commands. Preserve counterexamples, ordered prerequisites and missing/skipped/timeout refusals.
All eleven catalogue adapters remain resolved (163 cases/54 mutations). The manifest now has 609
obligations and 412 unresolved (253 test-file, 96 command, 63 campaign). A file receipt does not
credit its whole package/wrapper. P-06 current crypto prose and the selected immutable aggregate
follow integration, before private Account walkthrough preparation and human recovery/adoption work.

**Product position.** Personal Local cutover/cleanup/offline upgrades are exercised. Account remains
the private creating-member ciphertext round trip, Stage 4 §3.5 item 5, unmounted in the personal app;
no real Account admission receipt exists. The author's old second device must adopt the first workspace
with fresh custody, store, counters and credentials, without importing/merging its old writing.
Membership/revocation/rotation, signout/remove/reset, continuity, operations/deployment and public
assurance remain later work. Wider F-21.4 privacy, F-09 Account/key-loss/malicious-member recovery,
F-07/F-17/F-19 workload capacity and Q-08 publication/evidence policy remain visible.

**Preservation.** All 21 pinned personal/package files, 31 prior vectors and L-2 remain byte-identical.
Personal browser/profile/recovery/factor/key/service/origin/routing and root `done ` remain untouched.
Historical review/intake/evidence bytes, formal debts and signing backups are unchanged. The thirty-
commit signing sweep is complete; R-01 was signed normally. The aggregate needs its own signed revision.

## Active slice: Stage 4's first pieces — authorization, acceptance and transition integration (`L-2`)

```yaml
gate: L-2
seat: .claude/worktrees/l2-onboarding-863db1
branch: claude/l2-onboarding-863db1 # forked from claude/l1-contract-pass at 1375ee6
status: in flight # R3-4 paid; the slot verifier landed; the account service is next
plan: [sequencing.md §3.5, action-tree.md L-2]
prerequisites: S0-10 (closed 2026-08-29), especially S0-2/S0-4 — not L-1
debts: none # node scripts/check-debts.mjs --gate L-2 lifts
updated: 2026-08-29
```

**Why this runs beside `L-1` rather than after it.** `L-2`'s prerequisites are `S0-10`, especially `S0-2` and
`S0-4` — [action-tree.md](./review/remediation/action-tree.md)'s node names them and does not name `L-1`. The
two rejoin at `L-3`, which lists both. The critical-path diagram in
[sequencing.md](./sequencing.md) §4 draws Stage 4 after Stage 2 because that is the order the *product* ships
in; §5.1 already settled that the service's construction does not wait, since *ships* means someone else's
data and the author synchronizing his own devices is development. So milestones 5 and 6 are reached while
review 3b is out, and what waits for 3b's answer is exposing another person to it.

**What this slice is.** Stage 4's internal order, taken in order (§3.5): the account service, the
authenticator and the device-local slot verifier; the recovery keypair and the code ceremony; the
authorization lineage, first signed head, genesis checkpoint and promotion; device signing and wrapping
credentials; the envelope layer, relay rewrite and content-blind durable store; enrollment's two gates; the
device list; rotation, revocation, acceptance evidence and the finalization boundary. **Mostly indivisible:**
a device list that cannot revoke is worse than no device list, so nothing ships until item 8.

**What has landed.**

- **`R3-4`, first, because it was owed first** (`fbdbfb4`). `S0-9` round 3 returned member-entry uniqueness to
  `S0-2`'s homes *before `L-2` implements a verifier*, and this is that moment. A certified set carrying two
  entries under one `credential_id` is now malformed at both homes, the four map entries pinning them are
  re-pinned with every entry held, and `pnpm recipient:check` carries the sentence as a byte rule — added
  beyond the named repair because the generator's object-keyed `members` cannot express a duplicate, so no
  published negative can ever cover it. Recorded at
  [`S0-2/README.md`](./review/remediation/S0-2/README.md) and as a dated addendum on the disposition.
  **This makes one line of the `L-1` document above stale** — its *not in this slice* paragraph still says
  `R3-4` is owed. Correct then, wrong now, and the `L-1` seat's line to drop rather than this one's to edit:
  the separator only means anything if it holds when crossing it would be convenient.
- **The device-local slot verifier** (`b8c267a`), `src/account/slotUnlock.ts` — TRD §13.9, §15 row 12, item 1's
  half that needs nothing from `L-1`. The service-signed binding is verified before the key it names is used;
  refusals are values rather than messages. Held to `test/vectors/account-credential.json`, with the negatives
  rebuilt against `src/` rather than replayed, and a fifteen-mutation battery run against it — eleven caught,
  four survivors all in the compiled-in encoding set, all closed by two tests that pin the check's *position*
  rather than its presence.

**What is next, in the plan's order.** The account service and the authenticator ceremony that mints these
credentials — the two halves of item 1 the verifier does not cover — then the recovery keypair and the code
ceremony, which §3.5 puts at account creation rather than later because there is no account without it.

**Two things `L-2` needs that it does not own.** §6.5's slot index is where a verified binding is *stored*,
and it is `L-1`'s item 2; the verifier is a pure function over published bytes and did not wait for it, but
the enrollment path will. And §11.2's hostile-relay tests need `relayNetwork()` in `test/replicas.ts` able to
withhold, reorder and deliver late — §3.5 names extending it as far cheaper than a second harness, and it is
worth building before item 5 rather than during it.

**Not in this slice.** `L-1`'s document above, which this seat does not edit. `L-3` and `L-4`, and the four
registered debts at `L-4`. The live Stage 2 cutover. Review 3b's answer gates exposure, not construction
(§5.1) — and reviewer answers that constrain implementation are `L-4` gates.
