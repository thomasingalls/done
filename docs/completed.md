# done — Completed work

**Append-only.** An entry is written when a slice of work closes, and is never edited afterwards. If
something recorded here later turns out to have been incomplete, that is a new entry, not a correction to
an old one — the record of what was believed finished, and when, is worth as much as the record of what
was.

**Chronological, oldest first.** New entries go at the bottom.

**What closes a slice.** Work is complete when its **exit condition** is met, not when the code is written.
Where [sequencing.md](./sequencing.md) states exit criteria for a stage, those are the condition, and the
entry says which of them were demonstrated and how. Where it does not, the entry states its own.

**Why this file exists separately.** Completed work will otherwise creep into either the decision journal
or the active-slice document, and it belongs in neither: [decisions.md](./decisions.md) is append-only but
records _why_, not _what shipped_, and [progress.md](./progress.md) is overwritten wholesale whenever the
active slice changes, so anything left there is lost on purpose. **When a slice closes, its outcome is
written here before `progress.md` is rewritten.** That ordering is the whole discipline.

## The entry format

```markdown
### What closed

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Commit:** `abc1234` · **Stage:** sequencing.md §x, or —

**Exit.** The condition that was met, and what demonstrated it.

**Notes.** Anything a later reader needs — what was deliberately left out, what it turned out to cost.
```

## Before the journal

**These entries are reconstructed from git history**, which is why they are terse. They record what landed
and when, on the evidence of the commits themselves. They do not reconstruct exit criteria that were never
written down: at the time, the phase exit criteria lived in the PRD and were assessed informally rather
than recorded. Entries below the rule are written as work closes and state their own evidence.

**One caveat this table should carry.** Phase 3 landed, but sync "works and occupies no supported
configuration" ([sequencing.md](./sequencing.md) §1): a shared bearer token in a query string, a plaintext
`Y.Doc` on the relay, three fields typed by hand on each device. It is complete as _development_
infrastructure and is not the shipped shape. Its exit criteria — a week of two-device consistency, a week
without falling back — are assessed at PRD §10 Phase 3, which `sequencing.md` splits across Stage 4.

### The documentation and tracking structure

**Date:** 2026-08-18 · **Commit:** `e4969a0`, on `claude/docs-tracking-structure-7c6b31` · **Stage:** — (housekeeping)

**Exit.** Project state has one home per kind of state, and no document claims a status it cannot maintain.
Demonstrated by: the README no longer tracking project state; `sequencing.md` carrying **Stage 0** instead
of **Now**, with no remaining reference to a live "now"; and four tracking files existing with their write
rules stated in each — [decisions.md](./decisions.md), [progress.md](./progress.md), this file, and
[performance.md](./performance.md).

**Notes.** The README's decision record was migrated rather than dropped, under a rule marking it as taken
against PRD Draft v6–v8 / TRD Draft v4–v7 with a mapping for the PRD section numbers that moved in v9. The
README's "Running it" and "What is here" sections became [development.md](./development.md) and
[codebase.md](./codebase.md); the codebase map gained seven rows for files that existed but were never
indexed, and a note that the property fleet runs with `persist: false`.

[performance.md](./performance.md) was seeded with one real measurement — 306.2 kB of the 350 kB budget —
and `scripts/check-budget.mjs` gained an opt-in `--record` flag that prints an append-ready row. The
latency rows still have no harness; building it is Stage 0's third item.

**What was deliberately not done.** `sequencing.md` §5's decisions were left where they are: that document
cites its own §5 throughout, and moving them would break it. `sessions.md` was not touched.
